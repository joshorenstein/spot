## What makes a playlist successful? <br/>
###### The point:
Data and visual analysis of simulated Spotify playlist data.  <br/>
###### The scripts:
**01 -** **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Descriptive analysis of unmanipulated data  <br/>
**02 -** **Dashboard Stats** - Made some stats for Tableau Dashboard including Trending % (DAU/MAU) and Weekly % (WAU/MAU). Cleaned token column and kept top 10000 playlists for analysis  <br/>
**03 -** **Model Exploration** - Multivariate regression analysis to predict MAU based on previous MAU and genre/mood interactions. Isolated significiant variables to find over and underperforming playlists. For exploratory use only!  <br/>

###### The visuals:
Presentation for meeting and two screenshots of Tableau dashboards.  <br/>
